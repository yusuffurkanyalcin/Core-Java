## Why builder design pattern ?
  - If we have a constructor with lots of parameters , we had better create this design
  - The design allows to create flexible instances, such as we define lots of variable in the class and we dont use all the variables by using parameter in the constructor of the class that we created , so In that case we can use this pattern
